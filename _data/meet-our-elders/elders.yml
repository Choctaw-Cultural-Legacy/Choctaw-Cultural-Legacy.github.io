  quote: They weren't like that [referring to today where almost everything is readily available]. They were staying as they were. I was like that too. Even with something like coffee. If there wasn't any coffee, they would take corn meal and burn it and make coffee from it. If they had cows, they would milk it. The would get butter [& milk] and we would eat and drink from it.

Momma, when she looked at it she said ‘It’s not tomato plant’. And he said ‘Yeah, when I told them I want tomato plant that’s what [they gave to me]’ . . . He bought a whole bunch, it was eggplant! We had a lot of eggplant, we gave it away . . . Even other non-Choctaws . . . heard about it, so they came and got it. We just had to pick eggplant every day. There were long rows, so we had plenty of eggplant to give away.
